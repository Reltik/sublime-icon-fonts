With Bootstrap 4 seemingly dropping support for Glyphicons, this new version
now supports vanilla Glyphicons Pro v1.9, including all sub-sets.

Supported icons:

* GLYPHICONS Pro (610 icons)
* GLYPHICONS Halflings (260 icons)
* GLYPHICONS Social (60 icons)
* GLYPHICONS Filetypes (130 icons)

Please note that there is one tiny difference between Bootstrap Glyphicons and
vanilla Glyphicons: the class-name "glyphicons" with an extra "s" at the end.
